# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the OpenKG AgentUI frontend.

## Project Overview

OpenKG AgentUI is the Agent Harness frontend for Intellect, built with Vite:
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 7
- **Routing**: React Router v7 (lazy-loaded)
- **Components**: shadcn/ui (locked, do not modify `src/components/ui/`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3 + LESS
- **State**: Zustand (local) + TanStack Query (server)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) via Axios
- **i18n**: react-i18next (17 languages)
- **BFF**: Hono (Node.js) in `bff/` directory for Harness-specific backend logic

## Architecture

This project was split from the Intellect monorepo. It consists of:
1. **Frontend SPA** (`src/`) - React application
2. **BFF** (`bff/`) - Node.js/Hono backend-for-frontend layer
3. **Nginx** (`nginx/`) - Reverse proxy serving SPA + proxying to intellect backend

API communication flows: Browser → Nginx → (intellect Python backend OR BFF)

## Common Commands

```bash
# Frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # Dev server (port 9222)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run test         # Jest tests
npm run type-check   # TypeScript check

# BFF
cd bff && npm install
npm run dev:bff      # BFF dev server (port 3001)
# Or run both together:
npm run dev:all      # Frontend + BFF concurrently

# API type generation (requires intellect backend running)
npm run gen:api-types
```

## Development Conventions

### CSS and Layout Debugging
When fixing CSS/layout issues (especially flex truncation, ellipsis, or element sizing), **always inspect the full parent hierarchy** for `flex-shrink`, `min-width`, and `overflow` constraints before applying fixes like `min-w-0`. Do not repeatedly apply the same fix without verifying the root cause.
- Before editing, explain: (1) the full flex/container hierarchy from the target element up to the nearest non-flex ancestor, (2) what constraint is actually causing the bug, and (3) how the proposed fix addresses that root cause.

### Scope and Boundaries
Respect explicit boundaries from the user. If the user says **"only fix the selected line"** or **"do not touch shared types/files"**, follow that instruction exactly. Do not investigate unrelated errors, modify shared schemas (e.g., `LlmSettingFieldSchema`), or refactor other files without confirmation. If a change outside the described scope seems necessary, ask for permission first.

### Internationalization (i18n)
For translation tasks, add keys **only to the explicitly requested language files** (commonly `src/locales/zh.ts` and `src/locales/en.ts`). Do not auto-propagate changes to all language files unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Style for `en.ts`**: Sentence case — first word capitalized, rest lowercase (e.g., `referenceAnswer: 'Reference answer'`). Proper nouns remain as-is.

### React Component Refactoring
When refactoring or extracting components, **verify layout behavior after each structural change** (especially `flex-1`, conditional rendering, or flex direction changes). Check that existing buttons, alignment, and responsive behavior remain intact. After extraction, verify: (1) all original props and behavior are preserved, (2) layout in parent contexts is identical, and (3) no syntax or type errors were introduced.

### State Management and Data Fetching

#### Query Key Factory (Mandatory)
**Never write raw `queryKey` arrays inline.** Always use a query key factory object that returns `as const` tuples. Raw arrays duplicated across `useQuery` and `invalidateQueries` are brittle, unreadable, and cause stale-cache bugs when key structures drift.

```ts
// ❌ Bad — raw array, hard to match with useQuery
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: [LLMApiAction.AddedProviders, params.provider_name, params.instance_name, 'models'],
});

// ✅ Good — factory reference, self-documenting
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: LlmKeys.instanceModels(params.provider_name, params.instance_name),
});
```

- Place the factory in the same file as the hooks, named `{Domain}Keys` (e.g., `LlmKeys`, `DatasetKeys`).
- Every `useQuery` and every `invalidateQueries` must reference the same factory function.
- Use `as const` on each factory return value for type-safe readonly tuples.

#### Cache Debugging
For React Query / cache invalidation bugs, **carefully compare query keys across all consuming components and mutation hooks**. Mismatched keys (e.g., with/without `refreshCount`) are a common root cause of stale data or duplicate requests.
- Systematically: (1) list every component/hook that calls `useQuery` for this data, (2) compare their query keys character-for-character, (3) check every mutation's `onSuccess` for cache invalidation, and (4) verify no parent re-renders are remounting the observer.

### Network Request Layering
HTTP requests are organized in three layers. **Never import `@/utils/request`, `@/utils/next-request`, or `@/utils/api` directly inside a hook**:
1. `src/hooks/use-xx-request.ts(x)` — React Query hooks; only call the service layer.
2. `src/services/xx-service.ts` — Register endpoints via `registerNextServer`, all going through `@/utils/next-request`.
3. `src/utils/next-request.ts` — The single axios instance; handles token, 401 redirects, and error notifications.

Interface types are split between two folders:
- Response/data shape → `src/interfaces/database/xx.ts`
- Request params/body → `src/interfaces/request/xx.ts`

Model-related endpoints (LLM provider / factory / my LLM, etc.) are consolidated in `src/services/llm-service.ts` rather than scattered across hooks. For GET endpoints, register with `method: 'get'` in the service, and on the call site pass `true` as the second argument to use the native axios config (e.g., `service.listProviders({ params: { available: true } }, true)`).

### Shared UI Component Lock
The folder `src/components/ui/` is the project's **shared UI library** — it contains both official shadcn/ui primitives and project-authored common components built on top of shadcn. Both kinds are intended to be reused across the app and **must not be modified casually**.

- **Do not modify, refactor, restyle, or "improve"** any file under `src/components/ui/` (including subfolders), even if it seems like the most direct fix.
- If a component does not meet requirements, **wrap or compose it** in a new component **outside** `src/components/ui/` (e.g., under `src/components/` or a feature folder), and customize via `className`, `props`, or composition.
- Exceptions require **explicit user approval** in the same conversation. When in doubt, ask first and propose a wrapper-based alternative.
- Adding a new shared component to `src/components/ui/`, or upgrading a shadcn primitive via the official `shadcn` CLI, is allowed only when the user explicitly requests it.

### React Patterns and Conventions
- **Prefer `requestAnimationFrame` or `useLayoutEffect`** over `setTimeout(..., 0)` for focus or DOM measurement operations.
- **Prefer `useTranslation` from `react-i18next`** over project-wrapped utilities like `useTranslate`.
- Extract complex logic into hooks or utils; keep components lean.
- Use `PascalCase` for constants and component names.
- Avoid duplicating component structures in JSX; favor render props or reusable components.

### Utility Libraries and Reuse
- **Time/date handling**: Use `dayjs` for all date/time formatting, parsing, and manipulation.
- **Utility hooks**: Prefer `ahooks` for common reusable hooks (e.g., `useDebounce`, `useSetState`).
- **General utilities**: Lodash is available for utility functions when needed.
- **Project utilities first**: Before reaching for a third-party library, check if the project already has an existing utility or hook that covers the need.
- **Extract and share**: If repeated logic cannot be satisfied by an existing project utility or a third-party library, extract it into an appropriate shared hook (`src/hooks/`) or utility file (`src/utils/`).
- **Check for duplicate patterns before adding**: When asked to add logic (validation, existence checks, API calls, etc.), first search for existing hooks/functions that do the same or similar thing — especially in the same file or sibling hooks. If a hook already does X, call it instead of re-implementing X inline. This applies to mutations calling mutations, utility wrappers, and boilerplate around API calls.
